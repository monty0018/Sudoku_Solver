# Sudoku Solver in C++

This is a simple Sudoku solver implemented in C++ using the backtracking algorithm. The program fills a 9x9 Sudoku board with valid numbers based on standard Sudoku rules.

## 💡 Features

- Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
- Uses recursion and backtracking
- Clearly formatted output grid
- Easy to understand and modify

## 🔧 How It Works

The program follows these steps:

1. Finds the next empty cell (represented by `0`).
2. Tries placing numbers from 1 to 9 in that cell.
3. Checks whether placing a number is valid (i.e., not already present in the current row, column, or 3x3 box).
4. If a valid number is found, it proceeds to the next empty cell using recursion.
5. If no number fits, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Backtracking algorithm
- Recursion
- 2D arrays
- Modular functions
- Basic control structures (if-else, loops)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `
